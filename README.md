### About

This project is a frontend minting page for a sample NFT project. It features three frameworks I have yet to work with until now: server-side rendering with **Next.js**, **ChakraUI** for styling, and **Hardhat** to bootstrap the smart contract needed to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.


### Some Notes
- I hope this application brings joy to fellow seal lovers, definitely had a blast building the retro, maritime-inspired theme!
- I have disabled the use of the smart contract to protect my wallet privacy, but will do research on how to better protect sensitive variable to re-enable the smart contract on an Ethereum Testnet.

Made with **Next.js**, **Typescript**, **Hardhat**, **ChakraUI**, and **React**.
